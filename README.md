# cob - a change of base Swiss army knife

## About
cob is a simple CLI utility designed to handle any base-changing problem thrown at it. With cob, you can easily convert integers to hex and binary.
cob is even capable of handling arbitrary bases up to 72 characters, using the ASCII character set.

## Supported Platforms
cob currently uses the GNU getopt_long extension for parsing command argumentsl, and as such will only compile on platforms that support this extension.
cob has been built successfully on Debian GNU/Linux 11 (Bullseye); other platforms have not been tested.
